# 🐾 Parker Portal (Preview)

Welcome to the public preview space for **Parker Portal** — a custom-built foster and rescue management system designed to support the daily operations of animal rescue organizations.

Built from real experience and needs, Parker Portal is being developed as an internal tool to help streamline foster coordination, pet record keeping, and communication workflows.

## 🔐 Why This Repo Is Limited

This repository serves as a **public-facing preview** only.

The full Parker Portal system is housed in a private repository to protect proprietary business logic and sensitive operational tools. Future updates here may include:
- Sample components or UI previews
- General architecture and use cases
- Case studies or screenshots (with demo data)
